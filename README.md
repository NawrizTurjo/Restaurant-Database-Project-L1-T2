## 🌐 Network Configuration (Running Client from Multiple PCs)

To run the client from two different PCs and connect to the server, follow these steps:

**Server PC Configuration:**
1. Unblock Firewall:
   - Ensure that the server PC's firewall allows incoming connections on the designated port (e.g., port 12345). You may need administrator privileges to make these changes.

2. Obtain the Server PC's IP Address:
   - Open a command prompt on the server PC.
   - Enter the following command to display the server PC's IP address:
     ```
     ipconfig
     ```
   - Look for the IPv4 Address (e.g., 192.168.1.100). Note down this address.

3. Start the Server Application:
   - Run the server application on the server PC. Make sure it's listening for incoming connections.

**Client PC Configuration:**
1. Install Java:
   - Ensure that you have Java installed on your client PC.

2. Update Configuration:
   - In the client application code or configuration, specify the server PC's IP address obtained earlier. You may need to modify a configuration file or provide the IP address as a command-line argument.

3. Run the Client Application:
   - Start the client application on your client PC.
   - You should now be able to connect to the server PC using its IP address.

**Connecting from Multiple PCs:**
- You can repeat the Client PC Configuration steps on as many PCs as needed to connect to the server simultaneously.

Please note that network configurations may vary based on your specific setup and operating system. Ensure that your server PC and client PCs are on the same local network for this setup to work. If you encounter connection issues, consider checking your firewall settings and network configuration.


Happy Dining!
